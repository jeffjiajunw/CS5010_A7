### Jar Overview

To execute each mode of our jar (in this zip) execute the following sample CLI commands:

GUI mode

```
java -jar res/ime.jar
```

Text mode

```
java -jar res/ime.jar -text
```

Script file mode

```
java -jar res/ime.jar -file res/sample.txt
```

### GUI Overview

The GUI is operated through a toolbar, with buttons that expose each feature of our application.

- The load button allows users to load images from anywhere on their computer. Only one image can be loaded and worked
  on at a time.
- The save button allows users to save images to anywhere on their computer.
- The red, green, and blue buttons extract the individual red, green, and blue components of an image, respectively.
  These buttons provide split previews for users to visualize what changes will be made to their image before they make
  it.
- The sepia button applies a sepia filter to the image.
- The greyscale button applies a greyscale filter to the image.
- The horizontal and vertical flip buttons perform flips to the image.
- The blur and sharpen buttons perform blur and sharpening operations to the image.
- The compress button allows users to compress their images. When clicking this button, a popup appears that prompts the
  user for the compression factor. The user can enter the factor, and then preview what the compression would look like
  with a split preview window, before confirming the operation.
- The levels adjust button allows users to edit the levels curve of their image. When clicking this button, a popup
  appears that prompts the user for three individual x-coordinates for the blacks, mid-tones, and highlights. Then the
  user can also preview the level adjustment before confirming it.
